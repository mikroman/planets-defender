A Cascade 50 game: from a compilation of games originally written in 1983.

This BASIC program here is presented in orginal form with a couple of notable REM's added to point to some errors. There are more. ie) sound is not set up properly. It was necessary to add to the program for the sound to work.

step00 is the base version.

step01 is a line separated version.

step02 attempts to split every line into separate command lines.

step03 has a completely commented program with notes on errors and code segment omissions and some pertinent additions.

step04 will be the next step - getting ready for ml conversion by setting strings, constants, and variables apart.

step05 will be the first conversion step to assembly.
